# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nanodegree Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

In this project I demonstrate my newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application:

1) Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
